AB  - Breast cancer (BC) in young women is rare, affecting only 4-6% of women under the 
      age of 40. Regardless, BC remains the most common malignancy among younger patients. 
      Recently, a significant increase in BC rates has been observed among pre-menopausal 
      subjects. Breast cancer in young women requires special attention due to its 
      specific morphologic and prognostic characteristics and unique aspects, including 
      fertility preservation and psychosocial issues (e.g. its impact on family life and 
      career). Young women are more likely to have tumors with higher incidence of 
      negative clinicopathologic features (higher histological grade, more lymph node 
      positivity, lower estrogen receptor (ER) positivity, higher rates of Her2/neu 
      overexpression). Also, they tend to be diagnosed at more advanced stages of the 
      disease. That, in turn, contributes to less favorable prognosis as compared to older 
      women. Young women are generally treated similarly to older patients. Surgical 
      management includes mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery, followed by radiation 
      therapy (younger women have higher local recurrence rates than older women, 
      especially after breast-conserving therapy). Although the basics of chemotherapy are 
      the same for patients of all ages, younger women have some special considerations. 
      It is important to consider options for fertility preservation before starting 
      systemic treatment. Patients should have access to genetic testing as their results 
      may affect the choice of therapy. Younger women and their families should receive 
      adequate psychological support and counselling.

TI  - Breast Cancer: Current Molecular Therapeutic Targets and New Players.
PG  - 152-163
AB  - Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the most frequent cause of cancer death 
      among women worldwide. Breast cancer is a complex, heterogeneous disease classified 
      into hormone-receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 
      overexpressing (HER2+) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) based on 
      histological features. Endocrine therapy, the mainstay of treatment for 
      hormone-responsive breast cancer involves use of selective estrogen receptor 
      modulators (SERMs), selective estrogen receptor downregulators (SERDs) and aromatase 
      inhibitors (AIs). Agents that target estrogen receptor (ER) and HER2 such as 
      tamoxifen and trastuzumab have been the most extensively used therapeutics for 
      breast cancer. Crosstalk between ER and other signalling networks as well as 
      epigenetic mechanisms have been envisaged to contribute to endocrine therapy 
      resistance. TNBC, a complex, heterogeneous, aggressive form of breast cancer in 
      which the cells do not express ER, progesterone receptor or HER2 is refractory to 
      therapy. Several molecular targets are being explored to target TNBC including 
      androgen receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), poly(ADP-ribose) 
      polymerase (PARP), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Receptors, protein 
      tyrosine kinases, phosphatases, proteases, PI3K/Akt signalling pathway, microRNAs 
      (miRs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are potential therapeutic targets. 
      miR-based therapeutic approaches include inhibition of oncomiRs by antisense 
      oligonucleotides, restoration of tumour suppressors using miR mimics, and chemical 
      modification of miRs. The lnRNAs HOTAIR, SPRY4-IT1, GAS5, and PANDAR, new players in 
      tumour development and prognosis may have theranostic applications in breast cancer. 
      Several novel classes of mechanism-based drugs have been designed and synthesised 
      for treatment of breast cancer. Integration of nucleic acid sequencing studies with 
      mass spectrometry-based peptide sequencing and posttranslational modifications as 
      well as rational drug design will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the 
      pathophysiology of breast cancer and help in evolving therapeutic strategies.

AB  - It has been suggested that physical activity in breast cancer patients can not only 
      improve quality of life. Influences on physical and psychological levels have been 
      evaluated, but effects on the immune system of breast cancer patients are hardly 
      known. A PubMed search identified relevant trials and meta-analyses from 1970 to 
      2013. This review summarizes the results of international studies and the current 
      discussion of effects of physical activity on the immune system of breast cancer 
      patients. Highlighted are effects of physical activity on the immune system. Seven 
      original articles and 14 reviews included in this review. Two original and the 
      review articles includes other tumor entities besides breast cancer.Evaluated 
      methods such as dose-response relationships for exercise in oncology, hardly exist. 
      Increased immunological anti-cancer activity due to physical activity is probably 
      mediated via an increase in number and cytotoxicity of monocytes and natural killer 
      cells and cytokines.

AB  - Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst women in the United States and 
      around the world. Although widespread use of adjuvant chemotherapeutic and hormonal 
      agents has improved mortality from breast cancer, it remains challenging to 
      determine on an individual basis who will benefit from such treatments and who will 
      be likely to encounter toxicities. With the rising costs of healthcare and the 
      introduction of new targeted therapies, use of biomarkers has emerged as a method of 
      assisting with breast cancer diagnosis, prognosis, prediction of therapeutic 
      response, and surveillance of disease during and after treatment. In the following 
      review, prognostic and therapeutic biomarkers, their utility in the management of 
      patients with breast cancer, and current recommendations regarding their clinical 
      use will be discussed.

TI  - Histological types of breast cancer: how special are they?
PG  - 192-208
LID - 10.1016/j.molonc.2010.04.004 [doi]
AB  - Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, comprising multiple entities associated 
      with distinctive histological and biological features, clinical presentations and 
      behaviours and responses to therapy. Microarray-based technologies have unravelled 
      the molecular underpinning of several characteristics of breast cancer, including 
      metastatic propensity and histological grade, and have led to the identification of 
      prognostic and predictive gene expression signatures. Furthermore, a molecular 
      taxonomy of breast cancer based on transcriptomic analysis has been proposed. 
      However, microarray studies have primarily focused on invasive ductal carcinomas of 
      no special type. Owing to the relative rarity of special types of breast cancer, 
      information about the biology and clinical behaviour of breast cancers conveyed by 
      histological type has not been taken into account. Histological special types of 
      breast cancer account for up to 25% of all invasive breast cancers. Recent studies 
      have provided direct evidence of the existence of genotypic-phenotypic correlations. 
      For instance, secretory carcinomas of the breast consistently harbour the t(12;15) 
      translocation that leads to the formation of the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion gene, adenoid 
      cystic carcinomas consistently display the t(6;9) MYB-NFIB translocation and lobular 
      carcinomas consistently show inactivation of the CDH1 gene through multiple 
      molecular mechanisms. Furthermore, histopathological and molecular analysis of 
      tumours from conditional mouse models has provided direct evidence for the causative 
      role of specific genes in the genesis of specific histological special types of 
      breast cancer. Here we review the associations between the molecular taxonomy of 
      breast cancer and histological special types, discuss the possible origins of the 
      heterogeneity of breast cancer and propose an approach for the identification of 
      novel therapeutic targets based on the study of histological special types of breast 
      cancer.

AB  - Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare form of breast cancer that accounts for 
      only 2% to 4% of all breast cancer cases. Despite its low incidence, IBC contributes 
      to 7% to 10% of breast cancer caused mortality. Despite ongoing international 
      efforts to formulate better diagnosis, treatment, and research, the survival of 
      patients with IBC has not been significantly improved, and there are no therapeutic 
      agents that specifically target IBC to date. The authors present a comprehensive 
      overview that aims to assess the present and new management strategies of IBC.

AB  - During the past recent years, various therapies emerged in the era of breast cancer. 
      Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease in which genetic and environmental factors 
      are involved. Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) are the main player in the 
      aggressiveness of different tumors and also, these cells are the main challenge in 
      cancer treatment. Moreover, the major obstacle to achieve an effective treatment is 
      resistance to therapies. There are various types of treatment for breast cancer (BC) 
      patients. Therefore, in this review, we present the current treatments, novel 
      approaches such as antibody-drug conjugation systems (ADCs), nanoparticles 
      (albumin-, metal-, lipid-, polymer-, micelle-based nanoparticles), and BCSCs-based 
      therapies. Furthermore, prognostic and predictive biomarkers will be discussed also 
      biomarkers that have been applied by some tests such as Oncotype DX, Mamm αPrint, 
      and uPA/PAI-1 are regarded as suitable prognostic and predictive factors in breast 
      cancer.

TI  - Breast cancer in young women: an overview.
PG  - 313-317

AB  - Despite dramatic advances in cancer research setting, breast cancer remains a major 
      health problem and represents currently a top biomedical research priority. 
      Worldwide, breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women, and its 
      incidence and mortality rates are expected to increase significantly the next years. 
      Recently the researchers' interest has been attracted by breast cancer arising in 
      young women. Current evidence suggests that in women aged <45 years, breast cancer 
      is unquestionably the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. This type of cancer 
      seems to be highly heterogeneous and has potentially aggressive and complex 
      biological features. However, management strategies, recommendations and options are 
      not age based and the 'complex' biology of this type of cancer remains uncertain and 
      unexplored. In this review, we summarize the latest scientific information on breast 
      cancer arising in young women highlighting the heterogeneity and the complex nature 
      of this type of cancer.
